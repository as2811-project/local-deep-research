Barnum is based on the idea that it is always preferable to have attention focused on a name than to be unnoticed.\\n\\nHowever, Australian’s flag carrier, Qantas, may not currently agree. A new study from research specialist YouGov shows that consumer sentiment towards the airline has soured sharply as news of its recent alleged misconduct spreads. What is more, its local rival, Virgin Australia, has witnessed gains in consumer sentiment amidst Qantas’ brand crisis.\\n\\nIt has been a challenging couple of months for Qantas that pushed its outgoing CEO Alan Joyce to step down in early Sep-2023, a couple of months ahead of schedule to enable the carrier to better chart a course through troubled waters.\\n\\nHis sudden departure came days after the airline faced legal action from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), for allegedly selling tickets for thousands of flights that had already been cancelled over a three-month period in 2022.\\n\\nThis itself followed a class-action lawsuit that accused Qantas of failing to refund passengers for flights cancelled during the COVID-19 pandemic and illegally retaining billions of dollars of customer funds.\\n\\nIt wasn’t the end either. Just a week after the leadership change, the High Court of Australia unanimously ruled that Qantas broke industrial law by illegally firing 1,700 ground staff at 10 Australian airports in 2020, upholding an earlier federal court ruling which the airline had appealed against.\\n\\nThe impact of this period on the Qantas brand has now been highlighted in latest research from YouGov and clearly shows that consumer sentiment towards the airline has soured.\\n\\nLatest data from YouGov BrandIndex shows that Qantas’ Buzz score (which measures whether consumers have heard more positive or negative things about a brand in the past two weeks) hovered around 10 points for most of Jul-2023, but dipped to 7.7 on 21Aug-2023 when it was served a class-action lawsuit for allegedly withholding refunds on cancelled flights, then dropped to 3.1 on 31-Aug-2023 when the ACCC started legal proceedings.\\n\\nBy the time Mr Joyce stepped down on 06-Sep-2023, Qantas’ Buzz score had entered negative territory at -1.9, according to the YouGov data, which meant more consumers heard something negative than positive about the brand over the past two weeks. It then plummeted to -7.2 by 14-Sep-2023, a day after Australia’s top court ruled that the carrier illegally fired 1,700 ground staff during the pandemic.\\n\\nQantas’ brand health plummets as it racks up lawsuits for alleged misconduct during the pandemic\\n\\n−10−505101520253035\\n\\nBuzz\\n\\nImpression\\n\\nIndex\\n\\n4\\n\\n3\\n\\n2\\n\\n1\\n\\n1\\n\\nAug 21: Qantas served class-action lawsuit for alleged failure to refund passengers for flights cancelled during COVID-19 pandemic\\n\\n2\\n\\nAug 31: ACCC sues Qantas for allegedly selling thousands of already-cancelled flight tickets over three-months in 2022\\n\\n3\\n\\nSep 6: Alan Joyce steps down as CEO\\n\\n4\\n\\nSep 13: Australia's High Court rules Qantas illegally fired 1,700 ground staff during the pandemic\\n\\n![](https://pt.dwcdn.net/0jb7A/datawrapper.gif?r=https%3A//www.corporatetravelcommunity.com/)\\n\\nConsumer impression towards Qantas also took a similar nosedive. Between the class-action lawsuit on 21-Aug-2023 and Mr Joyce’s early exit on 06-Sep-2023, the airline’s Impression score lost 10 points – declining from 26.9 to 16.9 – before falling to 8.3 the day after the High Court ruling, on 14-Sep-2023.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the flag carrier’s Index score (an overall measure of brand health calculated as an average of Impression, Quality, Value, Reputation, Satisfaction, Recommendation scores) more than halved over the same period: tumbling from 21.5 on 21-Aug-2023 to 10.2 by 14-Sep-2023.\\n\\nData from YouGov BrandIndex also reveals that Virgin Australia has emerged as the main beneficiary of Qantas’ ongoing crisis. Virgin Australia’s Index score, which was neck to neck with Qantas in early Aug-2023, has started on an upward trend since late Aug-2023 – as Qantas’ Index score moved in the opposite direction.\\n\\nBetween Qantas’s class-action lawsuit on 21-Aug-2023 and its change of CEO on 06-Sep-2023, Virgin Australia’s Index score rose from 25.1 to 27.6 points – before climbing to 28.8 by 14-Sep-2023, after Australia’s top court ruled Qantas has illegally fired ground staff during the pandemic.\\n\\nVirgin Australia sees gains in consumer sentiment amidst ongoing Qantas brand crisis\\n\\n05101520253035\\n\\nQantas\\n\\nVirgin Australia\\n\\nBonza\\n\\n4\\n\\n3\\n\\n2\\n\\n1\\n\\n1\\n\\nAug 21: Qantas served class-action lawsuit for alleged failure to refund passengers for flights cancelled during COVID-19 pandemic\\n\\n2\\n\\nAug 31: ACCC sues Qantas for allegedly selling thousands of already-cancelled flight tickets over three-months in 2022\\n\\n3\\n\\nSep 6: Alan Joyce steps down as CEO\\n\\n4\\n\\nSep 13: Australia's High Court rules Qantas illegally fired 1,700 ground staff during the pandemic\\n\\n![](https://pt.dwcdn.net/KYp5L/datawrapper.gif?r=https%3A//www.corporatetravelcommunity.com/)\\n\\nDuring this period, Virgin Australia also launched a baggage tracking tool covering more than two-thirds of its domestic network in Australia, and a self-service flight rebooking tool for business passengers whose flights have been disrupted, highlights YouGov.\\n\\nQantas’ smaller rival Bonza Aviation also recorded slight gains in consumer sentiment over the same period. The low-cost carrier saw its Index score increase from 3.1 on 21-Aug-2023 to 4.7 by 14-Sep-2023, although this remains more than five points lower than Qantas.\\n\\n- australia\\n- consumer confidence\\n- asia\\n- branding\\n- consumer affairs\\n- qantas airways\\n- south pacific\\n- yougov\\n- virgin australia\\n- sentiment\\n- brand recognition\\n- bonza\\n- europe/mea\\n- the americas\\n- brand identity\\n\\n### Weekly Newsletter\\n\\nClick Subscribe if you'd like to receive the latest corporate travel news and analysis.\\n\\n[Subscribe](https://www.corporatetravelcommunity.com/analysis)\\n\\n### Latest Analysis\\n\\n[![](https://www.corporatetravelcommunity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/CTC_Quote_Speech_Soundbyte-800x.jpg.webp)](https://www.corporatetravelcommunity.com/soundbytes-travel-and-aviation-industry-insights-week-ending-24-nov-2023/)\\n\\n#### [Soundbytes: travel and aviation industry insights – week ending 24-Nov-2023](https://www.corporatetravelcommunity.com/soundbytes-travel-and-aviation-industry-insights-week-ending-24-nov-2023/)\\n\\n- 24-November-2023\\n\\n[![](https://www.corporatetravelcommunity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CAPA_CTC_Sydney_Summit-1024x.jpg.webp)](https://www.corporatetravelcommunity.com/highlights-from-the-ctc-sydney-corporate-travel-summit-awards/)\\n\\n#### [Highlights from the CTC Sydney Corporate Travel Summit & Awards](https://www.corporatetravelcommunity.com/highlights-from-the-ctc-sydney-corporate-travel-summit-awards/)\\n\\n- 24-November-2023\\n\\n[![](https://www.corporatetravelcommunity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SustainabilityEnvironment-800x.jpg.webp)](https://www.corporatetravelcommunity.com/elite-plundering-planet-to-destruction-richest-1-account-for-more-emissions-than-poorest-66/)\\n\\n#### [Elite plundering planet to destruction;

While Bonza only competed with other airlines on 7 of its 37 routes, it had the potential to become a more meaningful competitor and represented an opportunity for a more competitive domestic market.\\n\\n![](https://www.accc.gov.au/tmp/ec00873f-ccb3-4489-9941-46931018da00/images/99cd3c7efac49b2104ef99653ce2760ebb1622f6cb68b24583efbbff4332c104.jpg)\\n\\n# Bonza had provided travellers with more domestic air connectivity\\n\\nBonza had been a key reason for growth in connectivity across the domestic network in recent years, as it sought to stimulate demand on new routes not offered by other airlines. The number of domestic routes across Australia had increased to 178 in March 2024, a net increase of 22 routes since 2019.\\n\\n![](https://www.accc.gov.au/tmp/ec00873f-ccb3-4489-9941-46931018da00/images/0beda6d3efbb14ff4b8a2b0ed679574f841e7c8f3279f05653bd2baa274a1976.jpg)\\n\\n# Passenger levels tracking along pre-pandemic levels\\n\\nOver the quarter to March 2024, domestic passenger numbers exceeded 2023 levels and followed the seasonal pattern along 2019 levels. Major entertainment events led to above average February passenger levels.\\n\\n![](https://www.accc.gov.au/tmp/ec00873f-ccb3-4489-9941-46931018da00/images/d24cf72d87b16371eedce4715a993d364b94d05c3b68da09ca33b11c36b8fb37.jpg)\\n\\n# Airfares have remained below December 2023 levels\\n\\nThe increase in capacity in both domestic and international markets over recent months has contributed to a decrease in airfares. Compared to the same months in 2023, average revenue per domestic passenger was lower in January and March 2024 in real terms. Average revenue per domestic passenger increased by $9%$ from January to February 2024, likely due to the surge in major event-driven demand.\\n\\n![](https://www.accc.gov.au/tmp/ec00873f-ccb3-4489-9941-46931018da00/images/d40809ebc21254c50abd521bf3d2fa4efa3a2f5074b38c95c334bb420a9d8ef8.jpg)\\n\\n# Cancellation rates improved in March, but most airlines still worse than the long-term industry average\\n\\nIndustry cancellation rates improved from $5.0%$ in December 2023 to $2.8%$ in March 2024 but have remained above the long-term average of $2.2%$ for over 2 years.\\n\\n![](https://www.accc.gov.au/tmp/ec00873f-ccb3-4489-9941-46931018da00/images/aaaac8ead2a84d8829e722aee441885875e0c6176fa3a0a31d79a45ea2ae6fb3.jpg)\\n\\n# Australian Government announces improvements to Sydney Airport’s demand management framework\\n\\nIn February 2024 the Australian Government announced that it will improve how take-off and landing slots are managed at Sydney Airport. The ACCC welcomes the additional opportunities for new and expanding airlines to secure slots, the focus on combatting slot misuse where necessary, and pathway to improved service reliability.\\n\\n# Executive summary\\n\\nAustralia’s aviation sector appears to have recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic, 4 years after state and national borders first closed. At the same time however, low-cost carrier Bonza announced on 30 April 2024 that it had suspended operations and entered voluntary administration, following just over a year in operation.\\n\\nBonza’s suspension of operations left passengers stranded, others holding tickets they might not be able to use, and staff stood down. While the administrators are exploring options for the future of the Bonza business, as at 15 May 2024 it appears that it will be difficult for Bonza to return to operations, with the lessor of Bonza’s aircraft seeking to reposition the fleet elsewhere.\\n\\nIt would be detrimental to competition if Bonza was not able to resume services. Bonza’s ability to bring competitive tension to the broader domestic airline market had been limited to date, due to its small fleet size and exclusion of the busiest domestic sectors from its network. However, Bonza’s presence represented an opportunity for greater competition to emerge in the concentrated domestic aviation sector, such as if the airline had continued to grow with more aircraft and entered busier routes connecting Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.\\n\\nIf Bonza does not resume services, the biggest impact on consumers would likely be the loss of connectivity for regional communities. Bonza had been a key reason for growth in connectivity across the Australian domestic network in recent years, with the airline offering 37 routes as at March 2024, 30 of which were unserved by other airlines. The ACCC will closely monitor the effect of Bonza’s suspension of services on ticket prices and price competition, particularly on the 7 contested routes.\\n\\nAccess to direct flights can be important to regional communities, providing opportunities for economic growth, as well as for people’s ability to visit family and friends. In March 2024 there were 178 direct routes flown by Bonza, Jetstar, Qantas, Rex and Virgin Australia across the domestic network, representing a net increase of 22 routes since March 2019. Our analysis of connectivity, measured by the number of direct routes and service frequency, also found significant variability between airports. Sydney was the most connected airport with 39 direct routes, followed by Melbourne with 36 routes and Brisbane with 33 routes. These airports also have the highest service frequencies. Meanwhile airports in Regional and Remote regions typically lagged far behind Major City airports on both metrics.\\n\\nThe developments around Bonza emphasise the importance for government policy to support competition in aviation, with the domestic airline industry remaining highly concentrated. The ACCC welcomes the Australian Government’s proposed reforms to the management of slots at Sydney Airport, as they should improve the ability for new and expanding airlines to access slots at the important hub airport in future.\\n\\nIn the first 3 months of 2024, both domestic and international air passenger markets showed activity levels either approaching or exceeding pre-pandemic levels. In March 2024 Australia’s major airlines carried nearly 4.9 million domestic passengers, representing $98.8%$ of the levels recorded in March 2019. This was around $3.3%$ (or 150,000 passengers) more than the levels reached in March last year.\\n\\nSome one-off events contributed to a spike in domestic passenger activity in February 1, compared to what is typically observed in that month. Most notably, Taylor Swift performed 7 shows to more than 600,000 people across 2 weekends exclusively in Melbourne and Sydney. Airlines added some capacity following news of her tour. For example, Qantas announced it had added 67 additional\\n\\nflights, or over 11,000 seats on Melbourne and Sydney routes. There was also a World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) event held in Perth for around 45,000 spectators, stimulating air travel to the West Coast.\\n\\nInternational airlines also continued to add capacity on routes in and out of Australia, such as Emirates announcing the reinstatement of Adelaide and Perth flights from October 2024.\\n\\nIncreases in airline seat capacity have contributed to a decrease in airfares in recent months across both international and domestic markets. In March 2024 average revenue per domestic passenger decreased in both nominal and real terms compared to the year before. Airfares spiked on some routes in February due to the aforementioned events.\\n\\nService reliability has improved in recent months despite remaining worse than long-term industry averages. In March 2024 the industry cancelled $2.8%$ of flights, which represents an improvement from $5.0%$ in December 2023, but below the long-term industry average of $2.2%$ . Similarly, on-time performance across the industry was $77.2%$ in March 2024, improving from $63.6%$ in December 2023, but worse than the long-term industry average of $81.0%$ .\\n\\n# 1\\\\. Introduction\\n\\n# 1.1 Government direction to monitor domestic airline services\\n\\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is an independent Commonwealth statutory agency that promotes competition, fair trading and product safety for the benefit of consumers, businesses, and the Australian community. The primary responsibilities of the ACCC are to enforce compliance with the competition, consumer protection, fair trading and product safety provisions of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (CCA), regulate national infrastructure and undertake market studies.\\n\\nOn 6 November 2023 the Treasurer directed the ACCC to recommence domestic air passenger transport monitoring under subsection 95ZE(1) of the CCA. This follows the direction issued to the ACCC by the former Treasurer, which expired in June 2023.\\n\\nUnder the direction the ACCC is to monitor prices, costs and profits relating to the supply of domestic air passenger transport services for 3 years and to report on its monitoring at least once every quarter. The direction applies until December 2026.\\n\\nIn announcing the direction, the Treasurer stated that ACCC market scrutiny will help ensure airlines compete on their merits and bring to light any inappropriate market conduct should it occur. The Treasurer also said that the direction will assist in providing continued transparency at a time when new and expanding airlines are still trying to establish themselves.\\n\\nThe ACCC’s monitoring and reporting on the domestic airline industry is separate but related to its enforcement of competition law under Part IV of the CCA. We will prioritise investigations about anti-competitive agreements and practises, and the misuse of market power. We will consider enforcement action where we form the view that conduct is likely to breach the CCA.\\n\\nShould the ACCC find that the level of competition within the industry is insufficient to meet the needs of consumers or identify anti-competitive behaviour that falls short of thresholds for enforcement action we will recommend potential policy options to government to improve competition.\\n\\nUnder section 95ZK of the CCA, the ACCC can compel airlines to give information and produce documents to the ACCC relevant to that airline’s supply of domestic air passenger transport services. We have established arrangements for Bonza, the Qantas Group (including Jetstar), Rex and Virgin Australia to voluntarily provide their monthly and quarterly data to the ACCC. These airline groups supply close to all regular domestic air passenger services in Australia. On occasion we also seek qualitative information from the airlines, such as Board papers about company strategy. The ACCC has legislative obligations in relation to its management and disclosure of confidential information. In accordance with these obligations the public monitoring reports will present only some of the information collected from the airlines.\\n\\n# 2\\\\. Industry developments\\n\\n# 2.1 Bonza suspends operations and enters voluntary administration\\n\\nIn April recent domestic entrant Bonza suspended its operations and entered voluntary administration, leaving passengers stranded and others holding tickets they might not be able to use, staff stood down, and the loss of dozens of direct routes.\\n\\nThe lessors of Bonza’s aircraft terminated Bonza’s leases late on the evening of 29 April 2024, and required Bonza to immediately cease to operate the aircraft. Bonza’s board then appointed Hall Chadwick as Bonza’s administrators.\\n\\nHall Chadwick are conducting investigations into Bonza’s business, property, affairs and financial circumstances. As at 15 May, it was still undertaking these investigations 6, including to determine whether there is any possibility of Bonza resuming operations. Hall Chadwick have said that the lessor of the Bonza aircraft was seeking to reposition the fleet elsewhere 7, suggesting that it will be difficult for Bonza to return to operations.\\n\\nVirgin, Qantas and Jetstar provided support to Bonza passengers left stranded by the grounding of its fleet, by offering complimentary seats on their flights where space was available.\\n\\n# Bonza had offered low airfares to stimulate demand on new routes\\n\\nBonza was founded by Tim Jordan in October 2021, with financial backing from US-based investment firm 777 Partners. It adopted a business model akin to that adopted by Ryanair in Europe, using low airfares to stimulate demand on routes that were underserved or unserved by other airlines. It first offered services from its primary base of the Sunshine Coast in February 2023, before opening bases in Melbourne in March 2023 and the Gold Coast in November 2023.\\n\\nBonza’s network comprised of 37 routes in March 2024. Of these, 35 routes connected regional locations and 30 were unserved by any other airline. Its fleet of Boeing 737 Max‑8s reached a peak of 6 aircraft in December 2023, but this fell back to 4 when one aircraft was returned to Canada for Flair Airlines and another remained parked. This was reportedly due to additional problems Bonza faced getting registration to replace the Canadian crew with Bonza crew.\\n\\nThe primary benefit for consumers arising from Bonza’s entry was the availability of direct flights to regional locations. As explored further in chapter 6, Bonza notably increased the number of direct routes across the Australian domestic network and offered low airfares, which enabled people to take holidays and visit family and friends when they otherwise would not have.\\n\\nWhile Bonza did directly compete with other airlines on 7 routes including between Melbourne and the Gold Coast, its ability to bring competitive tension to the broader domestic airline market was limited to date due to its small fleet size and the exclusion of the busiest domestic sectors from its network, such as between Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.\\n\\nBy March 2024 Bonza had only been able to capture $2.0%$ of the passenger market. Even if Bonza had been able to attract more customers, its market share would not have been much higher without the airline accessing and then operating more aircraft.\\n\\n# Multiple factors could have contributed to Bonza’s situation\\n\\nWhile further details will likely emerge in coming weeks or months, a number of factors may have contributed to Bonza’s current situation.\\n\\nNew airlines typically face high barriers to both entry and then expansion of operations. These barriers can include access to aircraft, access to airports and suitable slots, qualified staff including pilots, crew and engineers, the costs and time to build brand awareness and trust with consumers and competitive responses from incumbent airlines. New carriers also need to expand relatively quickly to realise the benefits of greater economies of scale.\\n\\nCEO Tim Jordan said that the project that would become ‘Bonza’ took from 2009 until early 2023 to come to fruition, which he said reflected the barriers to entry in Australia.\\n\\nAfter the announcement of the airline, Bonza incurred significant costs as it took longer than expected for it to meet regulatory approval from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA). This approval was obtained in January 2023, 6 months after Bonza’s first aircraft arrived in the country. It then took Bonza longer than expected to receive regulatory approval for 2 additional aircraft from Canada to be operated with Canadian crew, resulting in extensive flight cancellations in late 2023. Some industry commentators have questioned Bonza’s strategy of flying infrequent services to regional destinations on low volume routes not served by other airlines. While this has worked overseas, some commentators have said that regional destinations in Australia may not have the population size to sufficiently drive demand to fill the 186-seat jet aircraft flown by Bonza.\\n\\nTo date, Bonza had chosen not to directly compete with Qantas, Jetstar, Virgin Australia and Rex on the routes connecting Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, which are some of the busiest routes in the world. Although Bonza did not formally apply for slots at Sydney Airport, Mr Jordan had expressed a strong wish to offer new services into and out of Sydney but said that this was not possible due to the airline’s inability to access take-off and landing slots at desirable times. Mr Jordan also stated that its business model based on low airfares would require better commercial terms to be offered by Sydney Airport.\\n\\nSome industry commentators such as the Centre for Aviation (CAPA) have questioned whether Bonza’s owner 777 Partners had the resources or the appetite to adequately fund the airline through its first years of development. When Bonza launched, 777 Partners had a significant portfolio of 737 Max aircraft and orders for more. However, CAPA said that plans to add further aircraft did not materialise, which contributed to schedule disruptions, route cuts and delays in planned route launches. CAPA further said that the airline had nowhere near the fleet size that would provide the economies of scale to be profitable.\\n\\nThere have been reports that 777 Partners is going through its own financial troubles. In March 2023 Flair Airlines had four aircraft seized over unpaid leasing charges. More recently, a substantial credit rating downgrade for 777 Partners’ reinsurance company (777Re) led to the unwinding of a joint ownership arrangement with another company over 30 aircraft.\\n\\n# Implications for the domestic airline industry\\n\\nThere would be a number of implications for the domestic airline industry if Bonza is not able to recommence operations.\\n\\nThe primary immediate consequence for consumers would be the loss of the extra connectivity that Bonza provided, with the airline offering 30 routes unserved by other airlines. While some of these routes may attract the attention of the other airlines, it is reasonable to assume that the vast majority would cease to be served.\\n\\nConsumers would also lose the benefit of the limited competition that Bonza provided over its 7 contested routes, which resulted in consumers enjoying cheaper airfares. However, it is the loss of the opportunity for Bonza to develop further into a more meaningful competitor, including with a bigger fleet of aircraft and potentially offering services on the busier intercity routes, that is more significant.\\n\\nWithout Bonza, the prospects for a more competitive domestic aviation industry in coming years would rely more heavily on Rex expanding its offering. Previously a regional airline, Rex commenced intercity operations with jet aircraft in early 2021. However, like Bonza, it has not been able to grow its market share ( $5.0%$ in March 2024) to a level where it would offer a meaningful competitive constraint on the Qantas Group and Virgin Australia. Such expansion would require a larger fleet of aircraft and access to additional slots at Sydney Airport. Another possibility would be for another new airline to enter the Australian market.\\n\\nWhile the airline industry may always have greater barriers to entry than most other parts of the economy, government policies should support such entry and expansion as much as possible. In this regard, the ACCC welcomes the Australian Government’s proposed reforms to the management of slots at Sydney Airport, as they should improve the ability for new and expanding airlines to access slots at the important hub airport (see section 2.2).\\n\\nAirport charges can also be a notable cost item for airlines, particularly low-cost carriers. In its submission to the government’s Aviation White Paper process, the ACCC put forward several suggestions for addressing the market power of the major airports. We recommended enhanced information provision requirements for airports and access to arbitration to address the imbalance of power in commercial negotiations. We also called for a review of the Aeronautical Pricing Principles 15 ,followed by making them mandatory and enforceable.\\n\\n# The rights of consumers holding tickets for Bonza flights\\n\\nThere will be many people who have purchased tickets for Bonza flights which have either already been cancelled or appear unlikely to operate.\\n\\nWhen a business enters voluntary administration, consumers’ ordinary legal rights can be affected. What happens to consumers’ rights with respect to outstanding credits, gift cards, refunds and other reimbursements will depend on what happens in the administration process.\\n\\nAn administration process may result in the business trading out of administration, the sale of the business that has gone under to a new business, or the business being wound up.\\n\\nIf a business is wound up, it must pay the people it owes in a specific order. Consumers are normally considered ‘unsecured creditors’. Unsecured creditors are paid after other classes of creditors. This means consumers may only get some of their money back or nothing at all. The way that consumers paid for the airfares may impact on their ability to access a remedy.\\n\\nConsumers who have paid for their flights with credit card, debit card or through a secure payment provider such as PayPal, may be able to get their money back by requesting their finanical institution or card provider reverse the payment. This is known as a 'chargeback'.\\n\\nWhere a business enters voluntary administration, the appointed administrator(s) should provide information to consumers about what will happen with outstanding credits, gift cards, refunds and other reimbursements through the administration process.\\n\\nThe appointed administrators have set up contacts for impacted customers: 03\\xa08678 1600 and [bonzacustomers@hallchadwick.com.au](mailto:bonzacustomers@hallchadwick.com.au) .\\n\\n# 2.2 Reforms to the management of slots at Sydney Airport\\n\\nOn 21 February 2024 the Australian Government announced that it will reform the Sydney Airport demand management scheme to improve how take-off and landing slots are managed at the airport. This is in response to the Harris Review which in February 2021 recommended reforms to how demand management should be regulated to make it more fit-for-purpose to deliver better efficiency, competition and consumer outcomes.\\n\\nThe ACCC welcomes the decision to take forward reforms as they will improve transparency, crack down on slot misuse where necessary and help new and expanding airlines secure slots. For example, under the reforms, airlines wanting to change the times of slots to which they have pre-existing rights (historic slots) will no longer receive preferential treatment over new entrants.\\n\\nFreeing up slots at Sydney Airport, particularly peak slots, is key to increasing domestic airline competition and enabling new and expanding airlines to compete with Qantas Group and Virgin Australia. In that regard, Bonza last year explained to the House of Representatives’ Standing Committee on Economics that access to peak morning and evening slots is necessary for it to base aircraft at Sydney Airport. The Qantas Group and Virgin Australia have historic rights over most slots, including valuable peak slots and this helps them maintain competitive advantages over rivals. To combat slot misuse, the reforms will increase transparency about how slots are allocated and airlines’ reasons for cancellations or major delays. Independent audits of slot usage will start this year, the results of which will be published. The Government will also strengthen enforcement tools including penalties to take legal action for non-compliance where necessary.\\n\\nThe ACCC also welcomes the Government’s proposal for improved governance arrangements concerning the slot manager to manage potential conflicts of interest. The current slot manager Airport Co-ordination Australia is majority owned by Qantas and Virgin Australia and is responsible for administering the scheme including slot allocation, reporting, monitoring, compliance and financial management. The ACCC reiterates the importance of making slot management and compliance systems independent, robust and properly resourced.\\n\\nThe Government has advised that it will be consulting with the ACCC and other stakeholders on the best way to implement these reforms ahead of bringing forward legislation to Parliament.\\n\\n# 2.3 Qantas agrees to penalty and customer compensation for misleading consumers\\n\\nOn 6 May 2024 Qantas and the ACCC announced that they will ask the Federal Court to impose a penalty of $\\\\\\\\varsigma\\\\\\\\rceil00$ million on Qantas for breaching the Australian Consumer Law.\\n\\nQantas has admitted making misleading representations to consumers in breach of the Australian Consumer Law in respect of flights it had decided to cancel. Qantas has admitted it misled thousands of consumers from 21 May 2021 until 26 August 2023 by advertising tickets for tens of thousands of flights it had already decided to cancel and by cancelling thousands more flights without promptly telling ticket holders of its decision.\\n\\nQantas has undertaken to the ACCC to pay about $\\\\\\\\varsigma20$ million to more than 86,000 customers who were sold tickets on these cancelled flights, or in some cases who were reaccommodated on these flights after their original flights were cancelled. Qantas will pay $\\\\\\\\textcircled{<}225$ to domestic ticket holders and $\\\\\\\\diamondsuit450$ to international ticket holders.\\n\\nBy 10 July 2024 consumers will hear from Qantas and Deloitte Australia via email and text message with information on accessing a portal to facilitate the payment.\\n\\nQantas has also undertaken to notify customers of cancelled flights as soon as practicable and no more than 48 hours from deciding to cancel the flight. It has also undertaken to stop selling cancelled flights as soon as practicable, and in any event within 24 hours of its decision to cancel. The undertaking also applies to Jetstar.\\n\\nThe ACCC launched Federal Court action against Qantas in August 2023 alleging that, between 21 May 2021 and 7 July 2022, Qantas advertised tickets for more than 8,000 cancelled flights. It was also alleged that, for more than 10,000 flights scheduled to depart in May to July 2022, Qantas did not promptly notify existing ticket holders that their flights had been cancelled. Qantas has now admitted that its misconduct continued from 21 May 2021 until 26 August 2023.\\n\\n# 2.4 Airlines report mixed mid-year financial results\\n\\nIn its mid-year financial results, the Qantas Group reported continued profitable operations, while Rex recorded a loss before tax for the first half of 2023–24.\\n\\nThe Qantas Group reported an underlying profit before tax of $\\\\\\\\uparrow\\\\\\\\uparrow.25$ billion in the first half of the 2023–24 financial year. This result captured performance across the whole business, including international and domestic flying, freight and the loyalty program. Despite a $13%$ decrease from the first half of 2022–23, it remained the most profitable amongst all the domestic airline groups. Qantas noted that domestic flying on Qantas and Jetstar increased by $5%$ and $75%$ respectively from the first half of 2022–23. The underlying EBIT for the Qantas domestic network in the first half of 2023–24 was $S647$ million.\\n\\nThe Jetstar Domestic business unit reported significantly stronger financial performance in the mid-year results, as its first-half underlying EBIT increased by $35%$ from the previous year to ${775$ million.\\n\\nRex reported a loss before tax of $\\\\\\\\S2.1$ million in the first half of 2023–24. This is down from a $S75.7$ million loss in the first half of 2022–23. Passenger revenue increased from roughly $\\\\\\\\mathtt{S293}$ million in the first half of 2022–23 to $S377$ million in the first half of 2023–24 despite network schedule reductions. This contributed to a roughly $4%$ increase in total revenue for the same period.\\n\\n# 2.5 Domestic passenger demand exceeds pre-pandemic levels in February\\n\\nFor the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic, in February 2024, domestic passenger numbers exceeded 2019 levels. This was due to a couple of notable major events held across Australia including Taylor Swift concerts held over 2 weekends exclusively in Sydney and Melbourne. The Elimination Chamber, a professional wrestling event produced by the American company WWE, was also held in Perth in February. Since 2024 was a leap year, an extra day of passenger activity was also recorded.\\n\\nConsequently, the number of passengers who flew into and out of Melbourne and Sydney in February 2024 increased by $18%$ and $75%$ respectively compared to February 2023. These were still just below passenger levels travelling pre-pandemic (February 2019) by $7%$ for Melbourne and $4%$ for Sydney.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the number of passengers who flew into and out of Perth in February 2024 increased by $9%$ when compared to February 2023, and by $74%$ compared to February 2019. This represented an increase of 55,000 and 78,000 passengers compared to February 2023 and February 2019 respectively.\\n\\nAirlines have indicated that with a few months of advance notice, they are able to add capacity to meet increased demand from major national events. The Taylor Swift concerts, for example, saw airlines use standby aircraft or capacity from other routes to keep up with increased travel demand. Where demand surges at short notice, for example when supporters want to travel interstate during elimination finals, the airlines’ ability to add services or increase aircraft gauge is more limited. This typically leads to higher airfares.\\n\\nHigh passenger numbers continued into March largely due to an earlier Easter long weekend compared to previous years. Demand in April is anticipated to be softer as a result.\\n\\n# 2.6 International airlines continue to increase capacity on Australian routes\\n\\nGlobally, international travel surpassed pre-pandemic levels in March 2024, with revenue passenger kilometres (RPKs) increasing by $73.8%$ compared to March 2019. As at March 2024 total arrivals and departures to and from Australia was only $0.6%$ lower than in March 2019, but $24.6%$ higher than in March 2023.\\n\\nThere have been signs of strong activity, with international passengers in Perth Airport exceeding pre-pandemic levels in January and February $2024,^{23}$ while Melbourne Airport hosted a record 923,065 international passengers in March 2024.\\n\\nData from Flight Centre Corporate’s FCM Travel and Corporate Traveller for the quarter ending March 2024 showed that global seat capacity reached pre-pandemic levels for the first time. As a result, air passengers are benefitting from decreasing air fares. On some key international routes out of Australia fares dropped by up to $25%$ in the first quarter of 2024 compared to one year ago.\\n\\nInternational airlines also continue to increase or reinstate pre-pandemic capacity on their routes to and from Australia. Notably:\\n\\n\\x83Emirates will recommence their direct daily flights between Adelaide and Dubai from late October. This service carried more than 165,000 passengers in 2019. Emirates currently serves Australia with 63 flights per week to Brisbane, Perth, Sydney and Melbourne, transporting around 56,000 passengers per week to and from these Major Cities. Emirates will also reinstate its second daily Perth service on a Boeing 777-300ER, joining the existing A380 service.\\n\\n\\x83Turkish Airlines debuted its Istanbul – Singapore – Melbourne flight from 2 March 2024, operating 3 times a week. Turkish Airlines is also planning to use the upgraded Airbus A350-1000 aircraft to fly directly from Melbourne and Sydney to Istanbul likely from 2026, competing with Qantas’ Project Sunrise (which will fly from Sydney or Melbourne direct to London). This entry may give Australian travellers extra capacity to travel to Europe and place downward pressure on airfares.\\n\\n\\x83Delta Air Lines will also commence its seasonal Los Angeles – Brisbane service from later this year until March 2025.\\n\\n\\x83AirAsia Malaysia commenced daily services between Perth and Kuala Lumpur, along with its sister airline AirAsia X, doubling the group’s flight frequency from 7 to 14 times per week from 11 March 2024.\\n\\n\\x83Singapore Airlines is adding 4 more flights to Brisbane from August, to total 25 flights weekly between Singapore and Brisbane. In addition Singapore Airlines launched flights to Cairns 4 times a week, which will bring around 23,000 extra seats per year.\\n\\n\\x83Jetstar commenced the first direct flights between Sydney and Japan’s Osaka (Kansai) from early April, with 3 return services per week.\\n\\n# 2.7 Qantas announces changes to its loyalty program\\n\\nOn 8 April 2024 Qantas announced changes to its loyalty program. Classic Plus is a new type of reward seat that is available for flights commencing from 1 July 2024 and essentially provides a points redemption conversion amount for commercially available fares. It is expected that the new initiative will have fully launched across Qantas’ domestic and international network by the end of 2024.\\n\\nThe announcement follows general consumer dissatisfaction about their experience with the Qantas frequent flyer program, including as noted in submissions made to the Senate Inquiry into Bilateral Air Service Agreements in September 2023. The key consumer concerns include the insufficient value of frequent flyer points and the lack of seats available for redeeming points. Given the way the new Classic Plus Reward fares work, it will increase the availability of reward seats, however these seats will usually require more points to redeem than the usual Classic reward seats.\\n\\n# 3\\\\. Industry activity and reliability of performance\\n\\nThis chapter analyses domestic airline passenger numbers, seat capacity and rates of flight cancellations and delays.\\n\\nBonza, the Qantas Group (comprising Qantas and Jetstar), Rex and Virgin Australia (including Tigerair until March 2020) supplied the ACCC with monthly passenger and seat capacity data up to March 2024 to inform our analysis in section 3.1.\\n\\nSection 3.2 uses Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics (BITRE) data up to March 2024 to analyse cancellation rates and on-time performance.\\n\\n# 3.1 Passenger levels and capacity tracking along pre-pandemic levels\\n\\nAnalysis of domestic airline activity in the first 3 months of 2024 indicates that the industry has recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic, with passenger levels, seat capacity and load factors all either surpassing or close to 2019 levels. This compares to activity levels observed in 2023 that suggested the industry was still in recovery.\\n\\nFigure 1 shows the monthly passenger levels and seat capacity for 2019, 2023 and 2024. It indicates there was greater levels of domestic travel in the first 3 months of 2024 compared to the 12 months prior.\\n\\n![](https://www.accc.gov.au/tmp/ec00873f-ccb3-4489-9941-46931018da00/images/bf388dfe8d8f05db62af0f2a812fe96dd63ed9b1d2fffd990d622c9d16b9d29a.jpg)\\n\\nFigure 1: Monthly passenger levels and seat capacity – 2019, 2023 and 2024\\n\\nSource: Data collected by the ACCC from Bonza, Jetstar, Qantas, Rex and Virgin Australia.\\n\\nAustralia’s major airlines carried 4.9 million domestic passengers in March 2024. This represented $98.8%$ of March 2019 levels and was $3.3%$ higher than in March 2023.\\n\\nIn February passenger numbers surpassed pre-pandemic levels for the first time. Australian airlines carried nearly 4.5 million domestic passengers in February 2024. This was $702.6%$ of the levels recorded in February 2019. As detailed in section 2.5, the higher than usual February passenger levels in 2024 reflected increased demand in domestic travel due to significant one-off events.\\n\\nSimilarly, airline seat capacity generally tracked along pre-pandemic levels for the first 3 months of 2024. The airlines flew around 6.2 million seats in March 2024, which was just below seat capacity recorded in March 2019. This also represented an increase of 292,070 seats (or $4.9%$ ) from March 2023, when the industry was still recovering.\\n\\nThe industry-wide average load factor, measured by the percentage of available seats filled by passengers, has also tracked generally along pre-pandemic levels. In March 2024 the load factor was $77.9%,$ which was 1 percentage point lower than in March 2023 and half a percentage point higher than in March 2019.\\n\\nRoute recovery continues to reflect the structural changes in the market. Routes that rely more heavily on corporate travel, such as those between Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney, are carrying relatively fewer passengers compared to their pre-pandemic levels. In contrast, leisure-based routes such as to the Gold Coast are performing more strongly.\\n\\nFigure 2 ranks the routes connecting larger cities by the degree to which they have recovered to their pre-pandemic levels of passengers. Of these, 7 routes exceeded $100%$ of pre-pandemic passenger levels, including 4 routes to and from the Gold Coast and 2 routes to and from Perth.\\n\\n![](https://www.accc.gov.au/tmp/ec00873f-ccb3-4489-9941-46931018da00/images/0079e98902fa1860b56e2677687f40d84a5e21d77ad3cea8cb5317e3a8122363.jpg)\\n\\nPassenger levels on routes connecting larger cities – March 2019 compared to March 2024\\n\\nSource: Data collected by the ACCC from Bonza, Jetstar, Qantas, Rex and Virgin Australia.

In March 2024 the industry cancelled $2.8%$ or over 1,300 flights. Despite representing an improvement on the $3.6%$ cancellation rate recorded a year prior, it has remained above the industry long-term average of $2.2%$ for over 2 years.\\n\\n![](https://www.accc.gov.au/tmp/ec00873f-ccb3-4489-9941-46931018da00/images/e2aaa4b6bf40184226fccb95127ffd3ce1f375fbef2ad01b74c63c355a157fc6.jpg)\\n\\nFigure 4: Airline cancellation rates – January 2022 to March 2024\\n\\nSource: BITRE, On-time performance time series – March 2024; data collected by the ACCC from Bonza. Qantas figures include QantasLink and Virgin Australia figures include VARA. Note: A flight is regarded as a cancellation if it is cancelled or rescheduled less than 7 days prior to its scheduled departure time.\\n\\nQantas recorded the highest cancellation rate during March at $3.8%,$ followed by Bonza at $3.5%,$ Virgin Australia at $2.8%$ and Jetstar at $7.5%$ . Rex recorded the lowest cancellation rate of $0.8%$ amongst the airlines.\\n\\nFor Qantas and Jetstar, cancellation rates were higher in February, at $5.8%$ and $2.6%$ respectively. Qantas attributed their higher cancellation rates during February to mass pilot strikes in Perth. There were 550 flights cancelled (more than half of Qantas’ total cancellations) during this period due to seven 24-hour strikes.\\n\\nFigure 4 shows a spike in cancellations for Bonza in December. As noted in our February report, this related to Bonza having too few aircraft to cover their flight schedule. Bonza underestimated how long it would take to secure regulatory approvals to operate aircraft sourced from Canada. Although some scheduling changes and the entry into service of these additional aircraft led to improved network resilience and a corresponding improvement to cancellation figures from December to March, Bonza abruptly cancelled all services after lessors of the aircraft issued termination notices on 29 April (see section 2.1).\\n\\nCancellation rates on some major domestic routes such as Canberra to Sydney improved significantly from December 2023 $(5.2%)$ to March 2024 $(1.8%)$ . Both major carriers on this route recorded significant improvements to their cancellation figures. Qantas’ cancellation rates from Canberra to Sydney improved from $6.1%$ in December 2023 to $2.4%$ in March 2024, while Virgin Australia’s reduced from $3.7%$ to $0.8%$ for the same period.\\n\\nConsistent with the lower cancellation rates observed in March 2024 is increased on-time performance.\\n\\nFigure 5 shows that the industry reported $77.2%$ of flights as arriving on-time in March 2024. This represents more than 10,000 flights arriving more than 15 minutes late.\\n\\n![](https://www.accc.gov.au/tmp/ec00873f-ccb3-4489-9941-46931018da00/images/23e1660e00eaddde81e8163f7534fc772baedfc39911c64751a1d83117a04ea4.jpg)\\n\\nFigure 5: Airline on-time performance rates (arrivals) – January 2022 to March 2024\\n\\nSource: BITRE, On-time performance time series – March 2024; data collected by the ACCC from Bonza. Qantas figures include QantasLink and Virgin Australia figures include VARA. Note: A flight is considered on-time if it arrives within 15 minutes of the scheduled arrival time shown on the airline’s schedule.\\n\\nOn-time arrival rates substantially increased to March 2024, from $63.6%$ in December 2023. Despite the significant improvement, on-time performance remains below the industry long-term average of $81.0%$ .\\n\\nPrior to the announcements of suspended operations in late April (see section 2.1), Bonza’s on-time performance was the highest amongst the monitored airlines at $82.8%$ in March 2024. Virgin Australia and Jetstar both recorded 3 consecutive monthly increases from December 2023 with an on-time performance rate of $75.1%$ and $80.9%$ respectively in March 2024. This followed Virgin Australia’s relatively low on-time performance rates during the second half of 2023.\\n\\nAirservices Australia acknowledged that shortages in its air traffic control staff contributed to poor network performance at the end of 2023, but this appears to have improved in 2024. The proportion of ground delay minutes attributable to Airservices in December 2023 was relatively high at $76.2%,$ ,however this rate fell to $9.2%$ in April 2024. Overall, Airservices attributable interruptions have reduced since the high rate recorded in December. Notably, March represented the lowest levels of attributable interruptions in 12 months at $4.0%$ . While air traffic control staff absences are a factor contributing to poor reliability, other factors can also impact, including pilot shortages, pilot training bottlenecks, weather-related disruptions and some supply chain disruptions.\\n\\n# 4\\\\. Competition\\n\\nThis chapter analyses domestic airline competition by the number of routes operated by the 4 monitored airline groups and domestic passenger market share by airline.\\n\\nAs with Chapter 3, Bonza, Qantas Group, Rex and Virgin Australia have supplied the ACCC with monthly data to March 2024 to inform this analysis.\\n\\nThe 2 airlines within the Qantas Group – Qantas and Jetstar – are not considered to be in competition with each other.\\n\\n# 4.1 More passengers serviced by 3 and 4 airline groups\\n\\nConsumers are more likely to receive better quality of service, greater options and lower airfares when there is more competition on the route.\\n\\nFigure 6 shows the share of passengers who were flying on routes with 1, 2, 3 or 4 competing airline groups between January 2021 and March 2024. In March 2024 $51.9%$ passengers flew on a route with either 3 or 4 airline groups, compared to 2019 when there were no routes with more than 3 competing airline groups. This began to change in early 2021 when regional airline Rex acquired jet aircraft and commenced operations on intercity routes in competition with Qantas Group and Virgin Australia.\\n\\n![](https://www.accc.gov.au/tmp/ec00873f-ccb3-4489-9941-46931018da00/images/ccf60e3384884dd22a75ab32ad92bcd19db9a66dde1a87a5e319d8083510ac29.jpg)\\n\\nFigure 6: Share of passengers on routes serviced by 1, 2, 3 and 4 airline groups – January 2021 to March 2024\\n\\nSource: Data collected by the ACCC from Bonza, Jetstar, Qantas, Rex and Virgin Australia. Note: Airline groups comprise Qantas Group (including Jetstar), Virgin Australia, Rex and Bonza.\\n\\nBetween March 2022 and July 2023, most passengers flew on routes serviced by 2 airline groups. Since August 2023 more passengers flew on routes serviced by 3 instead of 2 airline groups. The recent news of Bonza going into voluntary administration will impact on this going forward (see section 2.1 for further details).\\n\\n# 4.2 The domestic air passenger market remains highly concentrated\\n\\nFigure 7 shows domestic air passenger market shares by airline groups. The market has remained highly concentrated with Qantas Group (comprising Jetstar and Qantas) carrying $61.8%$ of passengers in March 2024. This is followed by Virgin Australia (3 $\\\\\\\\cdot7.3%$ market share), Rex ($5.0%$ market share) and Bonza ( $2.0%$ market share).\\n\\n![](https://www.accc.gov.au/tmp/ec00873f-ccb3-4489-9941-46931018da00/images/84dbbbe968091d6b8dbf799afffa9e52ea139e010523cb74f4a0e88f2a10482b.jpg)\\n\\nAirline passenger market shares across all domestic routes – January 2021 to March 2024\\n\\nSource: Data collected by the ACCC from Bonza, Jetstar, Qantas, Rex and Virgin Australia.\\n\\nFrom January to March 2024, Virgin Australia, Rex and Bonza’s market shares all remained relatively stable. Over the same period, Qantas’ market share increased by $4.1%,$ to $36.4%,$ while Jetstar’s market share decreased by $5.5%,$ to $25.3%$ .\\n\\nThe fall in Jetstar’s market share between January and March 2024 reflects the lower demand for the low-cost carrier’s services for holiday travel as the summer months and school holidays concluded. Over the same period, Qantas and Virgin Australia’s market shares increased reflecting a shift in market demand to corporate travel.\\n\\n# 5\\\\. Airfares and jet fuel prices\\n\\nThis chapter analyses trends in domestic airfares and the price of jet fuel. The cost of jet fuel is a major contributor to ticket prices.\\n\\nBonza, the Qantas Group (comprising Qantas and Jetstar), Rex and Virgin Australia have supplied the ACCC with monthly data up to March 2024 to inform our analysis of average revenue per passenger in section 5.1. This section also draws on BITRE airfare data up to April 2024.\\n\\nThe jet fuel data in section 5.2 is current to April 2024.\\n\\n# 5.1 Airfares are stabilising\\n\\nAverage revenue per passenger reflects movements in airfares across all types of domestic tickets and fare classes. Much of the analysis in this section is based on changes in inflation-adjusted real prices.\\n\\nFigure 8 shows average revenue per passenger to March 2024, represented as an index to show changes relative to January 2019. This is illustrated in both real and nominal terms.\\n\\n![](https://www.accc.gov.au/tmp/ec00873f-ccb3-4489-9941-46931018da00/images/6d4c12ed9403986890422cfb1fbbe5e9bb14486b5217750cad67e01c3107a0f6.jpg)\\n\\nFigure 8: Index of average fare revenue per passenger – January 2019 to March 2024\\n\\nSource: ACCC calculations using data from the ABS and data collected by the ACCC from Bonza, Jetstar, Qantas, Rex and Virgin Australia. Note: (1) The average revenue per passenger includes both economy and business fare revenue. It excludes data associated with ancillaries, such as baggage fees, fees for seat selection, food and drink sold on board. (2) Data has been adjusted for inflation using ABS CPI quarterly data up to March 2024. (3) Grey bars indicate December and Easter holiday periods.\\n\\nNominal figures indicate what passengers pay for an airfare but does not account for changes in purchasing power due to inflation. In March 2024 average fare revenue was $79.9%$ higher than pre-pandemic levels (March 2019) in nominal terms, but $0.4%$ lower than in March 2019 if adjusted for inflation. However, average fare revenue decreased from March 2023 to March 2024 in both nominal (by $7.4%$ and real (by $4.8%$ ) terms.\\n\\nOver the 3 months to March 2024, average fare revenue was a little volatile, decreasing by $73.2%$ from December 2023 to January 2024 in real terms, before bouncing back in February with a $9.2%$ increase. It was likely that this was driven by the surge in demand as mentioned in section 2.5. Average fare revenue was relatively stable from February to March 2024.\\n\\nPrice indices calculated by the BITRE have also shown a fall in the real price of domestic airfares from April 2023 to April 2024. BITRE’s indices are based on the cheapest available fare and therefore may not represent price movements more broadly.\\n\\nFigure 9 shows the best discount economy airfares (measured in real terms) spiked in March before decreasing sharply in April 2024.\\n\\n![](https://www.accc.gov.au/tmp/ec00873f-ccb3-4489-9941-46931018da00/images/5772b3381ffcac67ed0d7bd752f49c9c5558156f73787e8cafc93082ce05fe18.jpg)\\n\\nFigure 9: Real price index of the best discount economy airfares – January 2019 to April 2024\\n\\nSource: BITRE Domestic Air Fares (Best Discount) index (cheapest available economy airfares). The price index is weighted across the 70 busiest domestic routes. Note: Grey bars indicate December and Easter holiday periods. Airfares recorded between April 2021–February 2022 may be impacted by the government’s half-price ticket program (TANS).\\n\\nDiscounted airfares are typically at their highest during times of school holidays, in particular the Christmas and Easter periods. In April 2024 the best discount economy airfares were $2.3%$ less than they were in April 2023.\\n\\nThe fall in best discount economy airfares from April 2023 to April 2024 was observed across many routes collected by BITRE. Airfares on some routes have reduced significantly more than others since April 2023. In particular, the cheapest return fares for Canberra – Sydney decreased to $\\\\\\\\mathtt{S203}$ (down $58%$ ) in April 2024. Similarly, several routes that have also decreased over the same period include Cairns – Gold Coast (down $29%$ to $\\\\\\\\mathsf{S298}$ ) and Adelaide – Perth (down $28%$ to $\\\\\\\\mathsf{S358}$ ).\\n\\nBITRE also calculates price indices for business and restricted economy airfares, which are derived from the lowest available fare observed by BITRE. Between April 2023 and April 2024, the price index for business airfares decreased in real terms by $5.6%,$ while it increased by $1.4%$ for restricted economy airfares.\\n\\n# 5.2 Jet fuel prices remain above pre-pandemic levels\\n\\nJet fuel is a significant contributor to an airline’s operating costs. Figure 10 shows the jet fuel prices in real terms between January 2019 and April 2024.\\n\\n![](https://www.accc.gov.au/tmp/ec00873f-ccb3-4489-9941-46931018da00/images/e246348b1adddfb97b5cd95fc76005e7f8ab16c0a00d7917604a5266d4cc1e05.jpg)\\n\\nFigure 10: Real jet fuel and Brent crude oil prices – January 2019 to April 2024\\n\\nSource: ACCC calculations using ABS, RBA and US EIA data. Note: US Gulf Coast Jet Fuel prices converted into current Australian dollar terms. The price an airline pays for jet fuel will also vary depending on the ports to which its aircraft operate and the respective region-specific jet fuel benchmarks. The latest month of data is to April 2024.\\n\\nThe price of jet fuel increased by $71.0%$ between December 2023 and April 2024, from $\\\\\\\\mathsf{S}151.3$ $\\\\\\\\S768.0$ per barrel.\\n\\nWhen compared to the record high prices in June 2022, jet fuel prices dropped by $37.3%$ . However, as at April 2024, jet fuel prices were still much higher than pre-pandemic (April 2019) levels by $20.3%$ in real terms.\\n\\n# 6\\\\. Connectivity in the domestic air passenger market\\n\\nAviation connects Australian communities and generates significant benefits to the national economy. Air connectivity is especially important in Australia given its large land mass and its highly dispersed population. People can often have few viable alternatives to air travel to see the country, visit friends and relatives, access health services and conduct business.\\n\\nAir transport therefore provides essential services to regional and remote communities, and supports the higher education, tourism, resources, construction and manufacturing sectors. Connectivity through more direct services, better service frequencies and affordable airfares play a large role in creating these economic and social benefits.\\n\\nAir connectivity is a composite measure of the ease and convenience of flying between various locations. This chapter explores Australia’s domestic air connectivity, including that which was provided by Bonza prior to its suspended operations by:\\n\\n\\x83the number and type of direct regular public transport routes offered by the 5 main airline brands (section 6.1)\\n\\n\\x83service frequencies at Australia’s domestic airports (section 6.2).\\n\\nSection 6.2 also uses the case study of the Adelaide to Hobart route to demonstrate the relationship between low direct weekly frequencies and passenger inconvenience in the event of flight cancellations.\\n\\nUnless specified, this chapter uses data provided by Bonza, Qantas Group, Rex and Virgin Australia. Although not included in this data, smaller airlines are also essential to domestic air connectivity, including to remote and regional destinations. Separately, several airlines operate dedicated charter services to transport the ‘Fly-in Fly-out’ workforces of resources companies to and from airports near mining operations in remote areas of Australia.\\n\\nThe Australian Government’s upcoming Aviation White paper will consider the role of airlines and airports in supporting regional economies.\\n\\n# 6.1 Bonza’s suspension a setback for recent domestic flight network connections\\n\\nThe Australian domestic air network had been growing in recent years, but this growth is now at risk with Bonza going into administration.\\n\\nFigure 11 illustrates the combined and individual changes in the numbers of domestic routes serviced by Bonza, Jetstar, Qantas, Rex and Virgin Australia between January 2019 and March 2024.\\n\\n![](https://www.accc.gov.au/tmp/ec00873f-ccb3-4489-9941-46931018da00/images/54d980e1bfc466aa449181c43cc6d6a1eb8dd1eb145c2e9272e0d55ad5192deb.jpg)\\n\\nFigure 11: Number of routes service by airline, January 2019 to March 2024\\n\\nSource: Data collected by the ACCC from Bonza, Jetstar, Qantas, Rex and Virgin Australia. Note: We use a minimum of 7 monthly flights on each route to count the number of routes. Routes with less than 7 monthly flights are not included.\\n\\nAs at March 2024 there were 178 routes across the domestic network. Over the preceding 12 months, the overall size of the domestic network has consistently exceeded 2019 levels. The main driver of the resurgence in the size of the domestic flight network of the past year was Bonza’s net expansion onto previously unserved routes, while Qantas has also increased its network since before the pandemic.\\n\\nOver the last 5 years, Qantas has serviced the largest domestic route network, peaking at 124 routes in March 2022 and down to 107 routes as at March 2024. Jetstar and Virgin have operated on smaller, comparably sized networks since early 2022, (58 and 59 routes respectively). In March 2024 Bonza’s network size was commensurate with Rex’s (37 and 42 routes respectively).\\n\\nFigure 12 shows the number of routes as broken down by Major Cities, Regional and Remote classifications. It shows that the increase in regional routes over the past year was the key driver of the overall expansion in the domestic flight network. By contrast, the number of routes classified as ‘Remote’ has not recovered to pre-pandemic levels and is down 8 routes relative to March 2019. We discuss these discontinued routes in more detail below.\\n\\n![](https://www.accc.gov.au/tmp/ec00873f-ccb3-4489-9941-46931018da00/images/7958c980ad103f919f8789628755902e9486d668cc7e478418c3888cd45619b1.jpg)\\n\\nFigure 12: Number of routes across the domestic air passenger network by type, March 2024\\n\\nSource: ACCC calculations using data collected by the ACCC from Bonza, Jetstar, Qantas, Rex and Virgin Australia. Notes: (1) Remoteness area is based on Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Edition 3 (ABS 2021 version). Major Cities routes: both airports are in Major Cities of Australia. Regional routes: at least one airport is in Inner Regional Australia or Outer Regional Australia, but not in Remote or Very Remote Australia. Remote routes: at least one airport located in Remote Australia or Very Remote Australia. (2) Routes with less than 7 monthly flights are not included.\\n\\nThe Australian Government supports remote and isolated communities through the Remote Air Services Subsidy Scheme and the Enroute Charge Payment Scheme. These schemes subsidise essential air services and promote connectivity on less commercially viable routes, including specific support for Norfolk Island and the Indian Ocean Territories. Australian states and territories implement various regulations and support mechanisms, such as capping prices, subsidising fares and assisting with medical travel costs, helping to ensure essential air services are maintained and accessible.\\n\\nFigure 13 compares the March 2019 and March 2024 total RPT route networks with a focus on new and discontinued routes. The map shows that the majority of the 44 new direct routes as at March 2024 were on the east coast of Australia. The main contributor to this change was Bonza, adding 31 of the 44 routes, as marked in purple in Figure 13. Of these, Bonza serviced 11 routes to and from the Sunshine Coast and 8 routes to and from the Gold Coast exclusively. Almost all (7) of the remaining routes serviced exclusively by Bonza operated to and from Melbourne.\\n\\n![](https://www.accc.gov.au/tmp/ec00873f-ccb3-4489-9941-46931018da00/images/88c1a3826ac4f46b28c26f800bf0a4714ad138c8bc3f34fcf29bb7674db268e9.jpg)\\n\\nMap of new and discontinued routes on the domestic air passenger network, March 2019 and March 2024\\n\\nSource: ACCC calculations using data collected by the ACCC from Bonza, Jetstar, Qantas, Rex and Virgin Australia. Note: For multi-hop routes such as Sydney – Lismore – Grafton, the route is shown as Sydney – Grafton. Route count is based on routes that operate a minimum of 7 flights per month. The Gold Coast – Perth route operated 6 flights in March 2024, and is therefore denoted as a dropped route. This map focuses on the mainland and Tasmanian routes only. Brisbane (BNE) to Lord Howe Island Airport (LDH) route is not shown on this map.\\n\\nAs noted in section 2.1, Bonza has not yet resumed services following the suspension of all its services and entry into voluntary administration in April 2024. If Bonza does not resume services, it would be a major setback to air connectivity in Australia, particularly for the Sunshine Coast of which Bonza accounted for $26.4%$ of the airport’s total monthly seat capacity along with other regional communities along the east coast.\\n\\nThe balance of 13 new routes contributed by the other airlines are marked in green, while the 22 routes that have dropped off the network since March 2019 are marked in red (as at March 2024). Of the routes marked in green in Figure 13, Qantas contributed 11 new routes including 2 new Sydney-based routes to Bendigo and Mildura. Meanwhile, Jetstar and Virgin Australia collectively added 3. Of these routes, Cairns – Rockhampton route was serviced by Bonza and Qantas, while Melbourne – Wagga Wagga was serviced by Qantas and Rex.\\n\\nRex dropped 12 routes over the observed period; the most of any airline. This comprised of 10 Regional and 2 Remote routes. The routes included Adelaide – Mildura, Broken Hill – Griffith and Coober Pedy – Port Augusta. Qantas withdrew from 5 Remote routes including Alice Springs – Cairns and Brisbane – Lord Howe Island. Jetstar and Virgin collectively withdrew from 5 routes. Although not included in the reported data, smaller airlines currently operate on some routes that the larger carriers have discontinued. For example, 3 routes dropped by Qantas (Alice Springs – Perth) and Rex (Northern Peninsula – Cairns and Newcastle Williamtown – Sydney) are now flown by Airnorth, Skytrans and FlyPelican respectively.\\n\\nA list of the routes dropped and added since March 2019 by route type can be found in the Appendix .\\n\\n# 6.2 Connectivity can vary greatly by location\\n\\nThe level of connectivity can vary greatly by where you live in Australia. As to be expected, passengers connecting to the domestic flight network at Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne airports can choose from the most direct routes and enjoy the highest service frequencies of any domestic airport.\\n\\nFigure 14 illustrates the degree of connectivity by the total number of direct routes serviced by the 5 monitored airlines. Airports with a greater number of direct routes are represented by larger dots. Sydney is the most connected airport with 39 direct routes followed by Melbourne with 36 routes and Brisbane with 33 routes. All airports located in Major Cities had 14 or more direct routes, except Canberra with 8 direct routes. Cairns (16 direct routes), Townsville (16) and Mount Isa (11) made up the top 10 most connected airports. Despite having a population of under 20,000, Mount Isa in northwestern Queensland has good direct connectivity due to its status as a major mining and regional centre. Given its remoteness, Mount Isa relies heavily on air passenger transport, particularly from Townsville, Cairns and Brisbane.\\n\\n![](https://www.accc.gov.au/tmp/ec00873f-ccb3-4489-9941-46931018da00/images/feb670cd40c3861eb997b67c182415472e1c0c6f9e58e15a300f212a8b95459f.jpg)\\n\\nFigure 14: Map of significant airport locations by degree of connectivity, March 2024\\n\\nSource: ACCC calculations using data collected by the ACCC from Bonza, Jetstar, Qantas, Rex and Virgin Australia. Note: This map focuses on the mainland and Tasmanian airports only. Cocos Islands Airport (CCK), Lord Howe Island Airport (LDH) and Christmas Island Airport (XCH) are not shown on this map.\\n\\nAccess to direct flights provides opportunities for economic growth, as well as for people’s ability to visit family and friends. There would be significant impacts for some regional communities should Bonza not recommence its operations. As the airline’s main operating base, Maroochydore (Sunshine Coast) airport would see a reduction from 14 direct connections to 3. Similarly, Coolangatta (Gold Coast) airport would see the number of direct connections halved.\\n\\nThe level of connectivity offered by a particular airport can also relate to the frequency of services across each available route. Figure 15 compares the connectivity of the 20 busiest airports in Australia by service frequencies, against the national average. Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane airports had the highest frequencies with 296, 250 and 201 average daily inbound flights respectively.\\n\\n![](https://www.accc.gov.au/tmp/ec00873f-ccb3-4489-9941-46931018da00/images/8fd5b0dc311fe6acd454d4befd86fc213a7b5d38f9e8bdb9d9b9af2e53369294.jpg)\\n\\nFigure 15: Average daily domestic inbound flights for top 20 airports, March 2024\\n\\nSource: ACCC calculations using data collected by the ACCC from Bonza, Jetstar, Qantas, Rex and Virgin Australia.\\n\\nThe other capital city airports had less than half of the Golden Triangle airports’ frequencies; Perth and Adelaide were at comparable levels (93 and 89 respectively), while Canberra had 51 average daily inbound services (comparable to the Gold Coast at 52 services). Hobart and Darwin had the fewest services of any state or territory capital city airports at 28 and 13 services respectively.\\n\\nIn March 2024 the national average frequency across the 100 busiest airports was 15 inbound flights per day. Notably, 62 of these airports had fewer than 5 daily inbound flights on average. The top 20 busiest airports accounted for $84%$ of daily inbound flights across the domestic network of the largest 100 airports by service frequency.\\n\\nIn terms of connectivity to Major Cities, Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne had the most average daily inbound flights from Regional airports (at 94, 83 and 62 respectively). Perth had the highest number of flights (34 daily inbound flights) from Remote airports, followed by Brisbane and Adelaide (14 daily inbound flights each). As noted above, there is a relatively high frequency of travel in Mount Isa due to the nature of the fly in fly out (FIFO) market as well as the region’s remoteness.\\n\\n# 6.3 Implications for passengers on less connected routes\\n\\nAs noted in section 6.2, connectivity varies significantly by airport, including on services between Major Cities. A major delay or cancellation on a route with low frequency services and where alternative modes of transports are unavailable, can be costly and inconvenient for passengers, as illustrated in the following case study. The case study example highlights some economic inefficiencies that may not otherwise exist in a more competitive market.\\n\\n# Case study: Options for a passenger who takes a trip from Adelaide to Hobart\\n\\nAs shown in Figures 14 and 15, although classified as a Major City, Adelaide airport’s connectivity in terms of frequency of flights and choice of destinations directly serviced is relatively lower than for other Major City airports.\\n\\nThis case study examines the options for a passenger who takes a trip to Hobart from Adelaide and highlights the inconvenience to consumers of Adelaide airport’s lower frequency connectivity where scheduled services are cancelled.\\n\\nAs at the end of March 2024 for a passenger who wished to travel to Hobart, there were up to 2 direct flights that operated each day:\\n\\nTable: Schedule of direct flights from Adelaide to Hobart, March 2024\\n\\n![](https://www.accc.gov.au/tmp/ec00873f-ccb3-4489-9941-46931018da00/images/81d5990ccc06adfae09dacdb31918fddaa6b3f8cf7cf772ef3309236b27961d7.jpg)\\n\\nSource: Centre for Aviation Data Centre, Jetstar, Qantas and Virgin websites (accessed 15 March 2024).\\n\\nThere were 3 airlines that operated a direct service on this route in March 2024 – Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin – and total flight time is approximately 2 hours. However, schedules on this route can change quickly and dramatically. There were multiple instances between March 2022 and 2024 where the number of direct flights dropped to 3 per week and were serviced by a single airline.\\n\\nAlternative options are to travel to Hobart via Melbourne or Sydney with Qantas, Virgin Australia, Rex, or Jetstar. In most circumstances this extends the travel time for these passengers to generally between 3.5 and 7 hours.\\n\\nThere may also be a significant time and monetary cost for consumers in the event of delays or cancellations. For example, Virgin Australia’s policy in the event of a cancellation is to move the passenger to the next available Virgin Australia service to the same destination. If Virgin Australia cancelled its scheduled Friday afternoon direct service from Adelaide to Hobart, the next available scheduled multi-stop flight to Hobart would be on Saturday at 6am via Sydney, while the next direct flight would be on Monday. This means at minimum, that passenger is faced with an overnight stay plus a 5.5 hour-long trip via Sydney, instead of a 2 hour-long trip.\\n\\nAirlines are required to meet the consumer guarantees in the Australian Consumer Law when they supply their services, such as the guarantee that services are provided within a reasonable time. Where services are cancelled in circumstances where the airline has not met these consumer guarantees, consumers are entitled to a remedy which may be a credit, or refund, depending on the circumstances.\\n\\nThe airlines have compensation policies that set out the further assistance they will provide if a consumer’s flight is delayed or cancelled, such as providing a voucher for, or reimbursing (up to a certain limit) the costs of, a meal and/or accommodation. However, an airline compensation policy cannot exclude consumers’ rights under the Australian Consumer Law consumer guarantees. As stated in the ACCC’s submission to the Aviation Green Paper, the ACCC considers changes are required to the aviation sector to improve outcomes for consumers given the lack of any effective mechanisms for consumers to resolve disputes and enforce their Australian Consumer Law consumer guarantees rights, as well as ongoing customer service issues.\\n\\nThe ACCC considers the following reforms would improve consumer protections in the sector:\\n\\n\\x83A truly independent airline ombuds scheme, with the ability to make binding decisions.\\n\\n\\x83The introduction of a targeted and fit-for-purpose compensation scheme for delayed or cancelled flights, which builds on existing Australian Consumer Law consumer guarantee rights and is underpinned by the ombuds scheme recommended above.\\n\\nThe ACCC is also advocating for reform to the consumer guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law to make it a contravention for businesses to fail to provide the remedies for consumer guarantees failures when they are legally required to do so.\", \"[Skip to Content](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/consumer-insights/consumer-trends/insights-aunz-traveler-behaviors/#main-content)\\n\\nSelect your location\\n\\nClose\\n\\n- [台灣](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/zh-tw/)\\n- [Deutschland](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/de-de/)\\n- [Asia, Australia & New Zealand](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/)\\n- [Europe, Middle East & Africa](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-emea/)\\n- [United States & Canada](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/)\\n- [España](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/es-es/)\\n- [Latinoamérica](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/es-419/)\\n- [France](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/fr-fr/)\\n- [Italia](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/it-it/)\\n- [日本](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/ja-jp/)\\n- [대한민국](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/ko-kr/)\\n- [Brasil](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/pt-br/)\\n- [ประเทศไทย](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/th-th/)\\n- [Türkiye](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/tr-tr/)\\n\\n- [台灣](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/zh-tw/)\\n- [Deutschland](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/de-de/)\\n- [Asia, Australia & New Zealand](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/)\\n- [Europe, Middle East & Africa](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-emea/)\\n- [United States & Canada](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/)\\n- [España](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/es-es/)\\n- [Latinoamérica](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/es-419/)\\n\\n- [France](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/fr-fr/)\\n- [Italia](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/it-it/)\\n- [日本](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/ja-jp/)\\n- [대한민국](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/ko-kr/)\\n- [Brasil](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/pt-br/)\\n- [ประเทศไทย](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/th-th/)\\n- [Türkiye](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/tr-tr/)\\n\\nAustralia & New Zealand\\n\\n\\n# Australia’s travel plot twist: How people’s tendency to change their minds can help brands grow\\n\\n\\nSarah-Jane Campbell,\\n\\nHermione Joye,\\n\\nJacqueline Wong,\\n\\nSam Yatish\\n\\n/December 2023\\n\\nHow common is it for Australian travellers to change their minds about their holiday destination, accommodation, or flight? More than you might imagine.\\n\\nOur latest study with Ipsos finds that more than 1 in 3 surveyed Australian travellers alter their destination, flight, or accommodation choices during their planning process.1\\n\\nOur latest Messy Middle research within the domestic and international flight categories also reflects this behaviour, showing us that brand loyalty is up for grabs. When presented with their first and second choice travel agent, almost half of Australian consumers will switch to their second choice, whilst only 1 in 3 switch to their second choice airline.2\\n\\nThe willingness of Australians to reconsider their travel choices and brands means it’s not enough for industry players like you to be their top pick while they’re making their plans. What matters is: Are you their ultimate choice?\\n\\nCritically, the race to win mindshare and secure preference is already underway as travellers step up on trip planning. In Australia, search interest for Accommodation and Air travel has grown by over 15% in 2023 as compared with 2022.3\\n\\n## Think with Google\\n\\nSource: Google/Ipsos, Travel Attitudes, Demand Research 2023, Australia, n=3,000 consumers who have intention to travel for leisure in the next 12 months, May 2023–June 2023.\\n\\nShareShare\\n\\nTo help you strategise on how to win travellers’ preference, bookings and revenue, we surveyed 3,000 travellers in Australia to uncover insights on what sways their decision-making. These findings, combined with our latest Domestic and International Flights Messy Middle research, will allow you to respond in strategic ways to capture share and grow your bottom line.\\n\\n## What causes Australian travellers to change their minds\\n\\nAustralian travellers may change their minds but they’re hardly fickle. They’re simply focussed on finding and choosing the best possible option to satisfy their personal interests and needs. And the yardstick for what they deem as ‘best’ varies across the categories of destination, flight, and accommodation.\\n\\nHere are the main reasons for why Australian travellers change their minds about their:\\n\\nDestinationFlightAccommodation\\n\\n## Think with Google\\n\\nSource: Google/Ipsos, Travel Attitudes, Demand Research 2023, Australia, n=3,000 consumers who have intention to travel for leisure in the next 12 months, May 2023–June 2023.\\n\\n\\nShareShare\\n\\n## Think with Google\\n\\nSource: Google/Ipsos, Travel Attitudes, Demand Research 2023, Australia, n=3,000 consumers who have intention to travel for leisure in the next 12 months, May 2023–June 2023.\\n\\n\\nShareShare\\n\\n## Think with Google\\n\\nSource: Google/Ipsos, Travel Attitudes, Demand Research 2023, Australia, n=3,000 consumers who have intention to travel for leisure in the next 12 months, May 2023–June 2023.\\n\\n\\nShareShare\\n\\nUltimately, Australian travellers are single-minded about going on their dream holiday. This means they’re willing to go the distance as they plan and make decisions, to fulfill their travel aspirations, even if it means changing their minds and revising their plans.\\n\\nIt follows that more than 2 in 3 surveyed travelers in Australia said they need to feel a strong sense of confidence that they've made the best decision before they book. It’s also why more than half of all respondents used other sources to cross-check the travel information they have to ensure it’s accurate.4\\n\\nFor your brand to influence travellers’ purchase decisions and win their confidence and bookings, there are three things you can do:\\n\\n## 1\\\\. Be the constant and ultimate source of travel inspiration\\n\\nGiven that travellers’ decisions aren’t set in stone during their decision-making process, it’s important for you to inspire and capture their imagination at every stage of their trip planning journey.\\n\\nAmong the travellers surveyed in Australia, their number one source of online travel inspiration is YouTube videos, compared to other sources, including documentaries, programmes, and social media platforms.5 And YouTube Shorts is one way you can fuel their wanderlust. Its rich, highly immersive video canvas lets you paint the inspiring getaway experience your brand provides and win the hearts and minds of travellers.\\n\\n## Think with Google\\n\\nSource: Google/Ipsos, Travel Attitudes, Demand Research 2023, Australia, n=3,000 males/females aged 18–75 with intention to travel for leisure in the next 12 months, May 2023–June 2023.\\n\\nShareShare\\n\\nBesides sparking desire, you can spur action with your video campaign using the newly launched [Demand Gen](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/13859703?hl=en). The AI-powered campaign integrates your top-performing image and video assets across touchpoints like YouTube, YouTube Shorts, Discover, and Gmail, and it lets you optimise your campaign to drive performance goals such as conversion.\\n\\nFor hotel and vacation rental advertisers, Hotel Feeds on [Video action campaigns](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10147229?hl=en) (alpha) can help you further stoke travel inspiration. The AI-powered campaign with the new feature displays a selection of your properties below your video ad in the form of a scrollable grid of listings. The listings are relevant to each viewer, so they can follow their inspiration by clicking on a property to get to the site to book a stay.\\n\\n## 2\\\\. Be present with information that drives confident decisions\\n\\nOur research also uncovered that Australian travellers are more likely to be confident in their booking choices and have higher repurchase intent when they’re satisfied with their experience of searching for information during trip planning.\\n\\nIn fact, those who are satisfied with their search experience are at least 3X more likely to be very confident in their booking decision, and at least 2X more likely to have strong intent to rebook with the same airline or accommodation provider.6\\n\\n## Think with Google\\n\\nSource: Google/Ipsos, Travel Attitudes, Demand Research 2023, AU, CN, IN, ID, JP, KR, TH, n=19,000 consumers who have intention to travel for leisure in the next 12 months, May 2023–June 2023.\\n\\nShareShare\\n\\nHow can we build confidence? We know from our latest Australian retail [Messy Middle research](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/consumer-insights/consumer-journey/messy-middle-2023/) that behavioural science has a strong impact on preference - so we wanted to drill down into travel specifically.\\n\\nIn our recent Messy Middle Flights study we tested the following behavioural science principles for choice:\\n\\n## Think with Google\\n\\nSource: Google/The Behavioural Architects, May 2023, Australia, n= 1,000 prospective online travellers in market for international or domestic flights. ages 18-75.\\n\\nGoogle internal data 2023 (H1 2023).\\n\\nShareShare\\n\\nWe found that applying just two of the top performing behavioural science principles7 caused at least 1 in 5 consumers to switch to their second choice airline or travel agent.\\n\\nSimilarly, we found that the application of just two of these behavioural science principles can be as compelling to at least 1 in 3 consumers as a 10% discount8.\\n\\nAcross both domestic and international flights, the research found that social proof is the most powerful behavioural science mechanism to counteract discounting.9\\n\\nConsider how you show up for travellers wherever and whenever they are searching, with relevant information that helps them feel confident about choosing you. Travellers will always love a discount – but smart use of behavioural science principles will enable you to communicate value beyond pricing strategies.\\n\\n## 3\\\\. Tap into AI-powered solutions to drive bookings at scale\\n\\nFinally, how do you achieve this at scale? Google’s AI-powered ad solutions will allow you to show up and be compelling with the right message for the right traveller at the right moment. Use Google Search [broad match](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2407779?hl=en) with [Smart Bidding](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7065882?hl=en) to maximise conversions on relevant queries, and combine it with Performance Max to enhance your search query coverage across Google's full suite of channels including YouTube, Display, Discover, Gmail, and Maps.\\n\\nThat power pairing of AI marketing solutions lets you discover untapped demand and drive incremental results from new search queries, channels, and audiences.\\n\\nAustralian travellers are a savvy bunch. They’re willing to change their minds about their destination, flight and accommodation, just so they make the best decisions for a memorable trip.\\n\\nFor you, this traveller behaviour is a valuable opportunity to inspire and influence them through YouTube as they dream and plan their trips, and ultimately, become their choice for bookings.\\n\\nBy understanding what can sway their decision, providing a constant stream of holiday inspiration, tapping into behavioural science to drive confident bookings, and using AI to amplify your expertise, your brand’s bookings will be ready for takeoff.\\n\\n## Others are viewing\\n\\nMarketers who view this are also viewing\\n\\n- [Article\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\nArticle **Lost and found: How 3 travel brands grew bookings with AI-driven marketing**](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/marketing-strategies/automation/travel-advertising-ai-marketing/)\\n- [Article\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\nArticle **APAC’s hottest destinations in 2023: How to keep up with travellers’ demand**](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/consumer-insights/consumer-trends/uncover-travel-trends-insights/)\\n- [Report\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\nReport **e-Conomy SEA 2023: Unlocking profitable growth in the digital economy with high value users**](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/consumer-insights/consumer-trends/e-conomy-sea-2023/)\\n- [Article\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\nArticle **How people decide what to buy lies in the ‘messy middle’ of the purchase journey**](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/consumer-insights/consumer-journey/navigating-purchase-behavior-and-decision-making/)\\n- [Video\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\nVideo **Search on: How Google AI propelled Virgin Australia’s revenue and market share to new heights**\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\nWatch now](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/marketing-strategies/automation/virgin-australia-ai-travel-marketing/)\\n- [Article\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\nArticle **Attracting Indian travelers: 5 major shifts travel brands need to make**](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/consumer-insights/consumer-journey/attracting-indian-travelers-5-major-shifts-travel-brands-need-make/)\\n\\nWe're making content recommendations better for thousands of readers.

To gain a competitive edge, travel agencies must adopt effective marketing strategies that cater to the evolving needs of Australian travelers. This report explores the application of behavioral principles in marketing, focusing on social proof and risk aversion as key drivers of consumer decision-making.\n\n**Introduction**\n---------------\n\nThe Australian travel industry is characterized by intense competition among domestic airlines (ACCC, 2024). To stay ahead of the curve, travel agencies must develop innovative marketing strategies that appeal to the changing preferences of Australian travelers. This report delves into the application of behavioral principles in marketing, specifically social proof and risk aversion, to enhance bookings.\n\n**Behavioral Principles in Marketing**\n------------------------------------\n\nResearch has shown that behavioral principles play a significant role in shaping consumer behavior (Google/The Behavioural Architects, 2023). Two key principles – social proof and risk aversion – were identified as top performers for domestic flights (Social Proof and Risk Aversion) and international flights (Social Proof and Category Heuristics).\n\n### Social Proof\n\n*   54% of Australian travelers rely on other sources to verify the accuracy of travel-related information (Google/Ipsos, 2023).\n*   Travelers are more likely to book with airlines that have a strong online presence and positive reviews (Qantas' brand health plummets; Virgin Australia sees gains in consumer sentiment, n.d.).\n\n### Risk Aversion\n\n*   Consumers exhibit risk aversion when booking travel arrangements, seeking assurance of the best possible outcome (Google/Ipsos, 2023).\n*   Travel agencies can leverage social proof and positive reviews to mitigate perceived risks.\n\n**Marketing Strategies**\n-------------------------\n\nTo capitalize on behavioral principles, travel agencies can implement the following strategies:\n\n1.  **Influencer Marketing**: Partner with social media influencers or travel bloggers to promote destinations and airlines.\n2.  **User-Generated Content (UGC) Campaigns**: Encourage customers to share their experiences through UGC campaigns, amplifying social proof.\n3.  **Risk Management Strategies**: Develop policies that address consumer concerns, such as flexible cancellation and refund policies.\n\n**Implementation Roadmap**\n---------------------------\n\n1.  Conduct thorough market analysis to identify target audience preferences and behaviors.\n2.  Develop tailored marketing campaigns incorporating behavioral principles (social proof and risk aversion).\n3.  Monitor campaign performance, adjusting strategies as needed.\n\n**Conclusion**\n----------\n\nThe Australian travel industry is poised for growth with the implementation of data-driven marketing strategies that cater to consumer needs. By leveraging social proof and risk aversion, travel agencies can increase bookings and enhance their market share.\n\n**References**\n--------------\n\nACCC (2024).
